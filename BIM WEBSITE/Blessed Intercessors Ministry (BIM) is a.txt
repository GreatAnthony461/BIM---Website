Blessed Intercessors Ministry (BIM) is a prayer-centered ministry founded on the power of intercession. We stand in the gap for individuals, families, and communities—bringing their needs before God and trusting Jesus Christ for divine solutions.

At BIM, we believe that through sincere prayer, faith, and obedience, Jesus intervenes in every situation. This is a place where burdens are lifted, hope is restored, and lives are transformed through the presence and power of Christ.
